Firearm, Martial Ranged Weapon, Very Rare

**Damage**: 1d10 Piercing
**Properties:** Ammunition (Range 100/600), Heavy, Reload (6), Two-Handed

**Special Properties:**
- **Scope:** If you use a bonus action to aim and steady this weapon, your next attack with it on the same turn gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll and its normal range becomes 600 feet and its long range becomes 1,200 feet until end of turn. You cannot use this feature if you have moved this turn. 
- **Giant Weak Point Attack:** When taking a shot at a target at least 2 size classes above you, you may choose to take a -10 to the attack roll. If your hit connects, you may roll an amount of die equal to the size modifier they have over you, for damage. So, if something is +6 size modifier over you, roll 6d10 damage.
- **Long Shot**: If you hit a target that is more than 600 feet away, the shot does 1d12 Piercing instead of 1d10 Piercing.
