Firearm, Martial Ranged Weapon, Very Rare

**Damage**: 1d10 Piercing
**Properties:** Ammunition (Range 15/100), Reload (5)

**Special Properties:**
- **Giant Weak Point Attack:** When taking a shot at a target at least 2 size classes above you, you may choose to take a -10 to the attack roll. If your hit connects, you may roll an amount of die equal to the size modifier they have over you, for damage. So, if something is +6 size modifier over you, roll 6d10 damage.
- **Close Shot**: If you hit a target that is within 15 feet of you, the shot does 1d12 Piercing instead of 1d10 Piercing.
- **Heavy Caliber:** This pistol is incredibly loud and powerful. Attacks made with it can be heard from up to 300 feet away. It ignores the damage reduction of enemies with the _Damage Resistance_ trait against non-magical piercing damage.
- **Armor Piercing**: When you shoot a creature wearing armor or with natural armor, you can treat the target's AC as 2 lower for that attack (to a minimum of 10).
