Gina Character Ideas:

She is a 500 foot tiefling RuneKnight fighter, she has a tail that is about 3 times her size in length and has plate armor carved into a castle.
Her skin is generally purple and she has a couple sets of horns, one set curves around and under her ears, the other set goes upwards and curves
half circle like a spear. Her ears are long like an elf, her body has a lot of piercings. She has a few on her ears, a septum piercing, piercings
on her nipples, a piercing on her belly button, a clitoris piercing which has a secret place of worship, and some on the tip of her long tail.

Regions:
Inside of her butt on the skin is a set of hotsprings, on her armpit is a forge, in the heels of her boots are cathedrals.
She wears an amulet with a war room in it.

On her clit is a special place of prayer for Mininl in a piercing, build for deep prayer and of course perversion from the puny Queen.
On her right nipple is a room for the queen, a proper royal chamber with the most comfortable quilts fit for a Queen.

On her Left Pauldrin is a dragon's roost for Catherine, so she may train dragons to use.
A room is carved onto the right horn for Catherine, she carved a spiral staircase that goes down into the helmet to get to the Roost.

A magical factory on her heart powers her armor and the magic that flows through it, built by her childhood friend, can also be used by friend to overcharge
or control her armor.
Deeper than the springs in her butt, right on her wrinkles is a piercing, holding a vacation home for her friend, after she found out hes a lil perv X3

At the top of the right heel cathedral is Fergus' workshop, he has access to the rest of the armor due to mantenience tunnels.
At the right Pauldrin is a workshop for Fergus, where he is working on a gun emplacement.


Other notes:

She is not too bothered by destruction or accidentally stepping on someone, a level of disconnect between her and folk that small, though she likes
to avoid it.

Shock's character a childhood friend that accidentally crushed and he became a warforged. She values this character as her closest.
