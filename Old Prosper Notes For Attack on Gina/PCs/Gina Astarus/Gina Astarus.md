# Concept

She is a 500 feet tall [[Tiefling]] [[Rune Knight Fighter]], she has a fiend tail that is about 3 times her height in length and has plate armor carved into a castle known better as [[Grav-Fortress Plate]].

Her skin is generally purple and she has a couple sets of horns, one set curves around and under her ears, the other set goes upwards and curves half circle like a spear. Her ears are long like an [[Elf]], her body has a lot of piercings. She has a few on her ears, a septum piercing, piercings on her nipples, a piercing on her belly button, a clitoris piercing which has a secret place of worship, and some on the tip of her long tail.


# Regions
## Armor
#### [[Hidden Hot-Springs]]
- Inside the ass of her armor, right next to the bare skin, is a set of hot-springs.
#### [[Pit of Flames]]
- In the armpit of her breastplate is a forge.
#### [[Holy Heels]]
- In the heels of her boots are cathedrals.
#### [[Kathrin's Roost]]
- On her left pauldron is a dragon's roost for [[Kathrin]].
- In her right pauldron is a workshop for [[Fergus]], where he is working on a gun emplacement.
- A magical factory on her heart powers her armor and the magic that flows through it, built by her childhood friend, can also be used by friend to overcharge or control her armor.
- At the top of the right heel cathedral is Fergus' workshop, he has access to the rest of the armor due to maintenance tunnels.
## Body
- She wears an amulet with a war room in it.
- On her clit is a special place of prayer for [[Mininl Mewa]] in a piercing, built for deep prayer and of course perversion from the puny Queen.
- On her right nipple is a room for [[Mininl Mewa]], a proper royal chamber with the most comfortable quilts fit for a Queen, situated within a piercing as well.
- A room is carved onto the right horn for [[Kathrin]], she carved a spiral staircase that goes down into the helmet to get to the Roost.
- Deeper than the springs in her butt, right on her wrinkles is a piercing, holding a vacation home for her friend, after she found out hes a lil perv X3

## Physical













Other notes:

She is not too bothered by destruction or accidentally stepping on someone, a level of disconnect between her and folk that small, though she likes
to avoid it.

Shock's character a childhood friend that accidentally crushed and he became a warforged. She values this character as her closest.
