# Concept

She is a 500 feet tall [[Tiefling]] [[Rune Knight]] [[Fighter]], she has a fiend tail that is about 3 times her height in length and has plate armor carved into a castle known better as the [[Infernal Castle]]. The tip of her tail is quite sensitive, and the tail itself can be used as a 5th limb, even grabbing smaller things with dexterity.

Her skin is generally purple and she has a couple sets of horns, one set curves around and under her ears, the other set goes upwards and curves half circle like a spear.
Her ears are long like an [[Elf]], her body has a lot of piercings. She has a few on her ears, a septum piercing, piercings on her nipples, a piercing on her belly button, a clitoris piercing which has a secret place of worship, and some rings on the tip of her long tail.

[[Mininl Mewa]] had paid for Teleportation Circles to be placed all around the armor and various piercings, spending some of her queendom's funds to do so. So, traversal is easy, and fast. There is even one that leads to [[The Cages of Gina's Personal Hell]]

She is not too bothered by destruction or accidentally stepping on someone, a level of disconnect between her and folk that small, though she likes to avoid it. She'd only really realize what's she's done if she knew the tiny person.

[[Shock's Warforged]] was a childhood friend that accidentally got crushed when Gina grew, and he became a warforged. She values this character as her closest.

As a [[Tiefling]], she naturally has a form of telepathy. She can use it on anything she can see, but also things very close to her body, such as everyone in her armor. It allows her to communicate both ways mentally.

She is wearing a [[Ring of Satiation]]; it allows her to grow any food or drink to her size in order to consume it. She needs to be within 1ft (relatively) of the food or drink.

Her party lives in various places across her body, but mostly in the armor, not against her skin except for [[Mininl Mewa]] and [[Shock's Warforged]].
# Backstory

One day, Gina the [[Tiefling]] had been grown to 500 feet tall during her ordinary day-to-day. She was doing something with [[Shock's Warforged]], when she was suddenly grown to this humongous size. She looked under her body at the destroyed landscape, and saw [[Shock's Warforged]] was dead. She went on an adventure, getting a [[Ring of Satiation]], and eventually getting [[Shock's Warforged]] to be revived as a [[Warforged]]. She also learned why she was grown; it was [[The Prophecy]] detailing the end of the world. As thanks, [[Shock's Warforged]] did all he could to make Gina the ultimate gift; Armor, Clothing, and a Castle, all in one. The rest of the party was gathered, and the campaign began eventually. 
# Regions
## Armor
#### [[Hidden Hot-Springs]]
- Inside the ass of her armor, right next to the bare skin, is a set of hot-springs. It's barred for entry except for those invited by Gina herself.
#### [[Pit of Flames]]
- In the armpit of her breastplate is a forge. This is where all of the blacksmithing happens. 
#### [[Holy Heels]]
- In the platforms of her boots are cathedrals.
#### [[Kathrin's Roost]]
- On her left pauldron is a dragon's roost for [[Kathrin]].
#### [[Fergus' Turret Workshop]]
- In and on her right pauldron is a workshop for [[Fergus]], where he is working on a gun emplacement.
#### [[Infernal Core]]
- A magical factory on her heart powers her armor and the magic that flows through it, built by her childhood friend [[Shock's Warforged]], can also be used by said friend to overcharge or control her armor, making it either like a set of power armor, or a pilot-able mech while Gina is out of it.
#### [[Fergus' Maintenance Headquarters]]
- At the top of the right boot cathedral is [[Fergus]]' workshop; he has access to the rest of the armor due to maintenance tunnels.
## Body
#### [[War Room Amulet]]
- She wears an amulet with a war room inside of it.
#### [[Gina's Deep Sanctum]]
- On her clit is a special place of prayer for [[Mininl Mewa]] in a piercing, built for deep prayer and of course perversion from the puny Queen.
#### [[Infernal Castle Queen Chambers]]
- On her right nipple is a room for [[Mininl Mewa]], a proper royal chamber with the most comfortable quilts fit for a Queen, situated within a piercing as well.
#### [[Kathrin's Ascent]]
- A room is carved into the right horn for [[Kathrin]], she carved a spiral staircase that goes down into the helmet to get to the Roost.
#### [[Gina's Deepest Desire]]
- Deeper than the hot-springs in her butt, right on her wrinkles is a piercing, holding a vacation home for her friend [[Shock's Warforged]], after she found out he's a lil perv X3
#### [[The Cages of Gina's Personal Hell]]
- Cages float over the acid, the air is thick and suffocating. This is the [[Infernal Castle]]'s Private Jail, and the safest way out is a Teleportation Circle. It's within Gina's stomach.
