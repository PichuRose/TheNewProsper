Firearm, Martial Ranged Weapon, Very Rare

**Damage**: 1d10 Piercing
**Properties:** Ammunition (Range 100/800), Heavy, Reload (5), Two-Handed

**Special Properties:**
- **Scope:** If you use a bonus action to aim and steady this weapon, your next attack with it on the same turn gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll and its normal range becomes 800 feet and its long range becomes 1,500 feet until end of turn. You cannot use this feature if you have moved this turn. 
- **Giant Weak Point Attack:** When taking a shot at a target at least 2 size classes above you, you may choose to take a -10 to the attack roll. If your hit connects, you may roll an amount of die equal to the size modifier they have over you, for damage. So, if something is +6 size modifier over you, roll 6d10 damage.
- **Bipod:** If you are prone, you have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon.
- **Heavy Caliber:** This sniper is incredibly loud and powerful. Attacks made with it can be heard from up to 1000 feet away. It ignores the damage reduction of enemies with the _Damage Resistance_ trait against non-magical piercing damage.
- **Armor Piercing**: When you shoot a creature wearing armor or with natural armor, you can treat the target's AC as 2 lower for that attack (to a minimum of 10).
