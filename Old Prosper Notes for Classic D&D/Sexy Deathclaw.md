The current main threat is the sexy Deathclaw they had deterred away. In the last battle, they had frightened her and also blinded her. She had almost impaled Umbra in a single hit, but didn't do much hits otherwise, missing several times. 

The Deathclaw needs to be able to have a fair fight, probably defending its actual nest to the death. It will be much smarter this time and avoid being frightened, plus there are no walls around to ram into.

The Sexy Deathclaw hunts by luring in unsuspecting straight men (and female loving women) with it's sexy body, then killing them effortlessly by biting, eating whole, cutting with claws, etc. 

The Deathclaw's nest itself is positioned quite a ways away from the mountain, at the part where the river meets the ocean.
